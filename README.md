# 📊 Bank Term Deposit Prediction

## 📝 Project Summary
This project uses real-world data from a Portuguese banking institution to predict whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit. By applying machine learning techniques, the goal is to support smarter, more efficient marketing strategies through data-driven targeting.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Predict client subscription to term deposits using supervised machine learning
- Compare model performance between Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Identify key features that influence client decisions
- Generate actionable insights to guide marketing outreach

## 📂 Dataset Description
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
- **Size**: 41,188 observations with 20 input features and 1 target variable (`y`)
- **Context**: Contains client information, economic indicators, and past campaign outcomes

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.10** (via Google Colab)
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas, numpy
  - seaborn, matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - SHAP (optional for model interpretability)
